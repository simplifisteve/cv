# Hello World!

My name is Steve Vong. I am an iOS and full-stack web developer.
Always love to learn and improve my knowledge on programming, computers, and cars.
I absolutely enjoy world traveling. Let me know your recommended places.

I look forward to collaborate on programming projects or building brand new computers.

Thank you and enjoy your day!
